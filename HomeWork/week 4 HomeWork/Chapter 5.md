List and dictionary are fundamentally different data structures.A list can store a sequence of objects in a certain order such that you can index into the list, or iterate over the list. Moreover, List is a mutable type meaning that lists can be modified after they have been created. Python dictionary is an implementation of a hash table and is a key-value store. It is not ordered and it requires that the keys are hashtable. Also, it is fast for lookups by key.
